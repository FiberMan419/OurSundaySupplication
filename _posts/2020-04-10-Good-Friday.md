<h1>Our Triduum Supplication</h1>

<h2>Friday, April 10, 2020</h2>
<h3>Good Friday</h3>

<p>The Paschal Triduum, the solemn observance of the Church from Holy Thursday evening through Easter Sunday, is to the liturgical year what Sunday is to the week. During these days, the Church commemorates the saving mysteries of our Lord’s final moments of suffering and his first moments of resurrected glory. It has been said that only one man could turn three days of intrigue, betrayal and murder into the holiest week of the year. That man is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, our Lord!<br>
<br>
During this time of unprecedented suffering throughout the world, we need, as individuals and families, to attach ourselves to the sacramental life of the Church. We are able to do this, virtually, through the many generous live-streamed Masses and services being broadcast on television and the internet. We are able to do this, devotionally, through such powerful prayers as the Most Holy Rosary and the Chaplet of Divine Mercy. But we can also, truly and really, by praying over the Holy Scriptures and sacred texts of the very liturgies we are unable to celebrate in church. This supplication series amins at providing the “domestic church” an opportunity to use some of the sacred words used in the Church’s rites.<br>
<br>
Now is not a time to abandon the praise and supplication of almighty God, for he never abandons us! Now is the time to love and serve the Lord as best we can in our limited capacities.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Celebration of the Lord’s Passion and Evening Prayer</i></b><br>
<i>Before we pray together, it would be fitting to place a crucifix before us.</i></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>
<br>
<i>All pause in silence, taking a brief moment to consider the amazing love which Jesus showed humanity by his death on the cross.</i></p>

<h2>The Word of the Lord</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 52:13-53:12)</h3>
<p>Peter proceeded to speak and said: “You know what has happened all over Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached, how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power. He went about doing good and healing all those oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree. This man God raised on the third day and granted that he be visible, not to all the people, but to us, the witnesses chosen by God in advance, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commissioned us to preach to the people and testify that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness, that everyone who believes in him will receive forgiveness of sins through his name.”<br>
<br>
<b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 118:1-2, 16-17, 22-23)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b>	This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad.<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b>	Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his mercy endures forever.
Let the house of Israel say, “His mercy endures forever.”<br>
<b>Together:</b>	This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad.<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b>	“The right hand of the LORD has struck with power;<br>
the right hand of the LORD is exalted.<br>
I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.”<br>
<b>Together:</b>	This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad.<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b>	The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.<br>
By the LORD has this been done; it is wonderful in our eyes.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Colossians (Colossians 3:1-4)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: If then you were raised with Christ, seek what is above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Think of what is above, not of what is on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ your life appears, then you too will appear with him in glory.<br>
<br>
<b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Sequence</h3>
<p>Christians, to the Paschal victim<br>
Offer your thankful praises!<br>
A Lamb the sheep redeems:<br>
Christ, who only is sinless,<br>
Reconciles sinners to the Father.<br>
Death and life have contended in that combat stupendous:<br>
The Prince of life, who died, reigns immortal.<br>
<br>
Speak, Mary, declaring<br>
What you saw, wayfaring:<br>
“The tomb of Christ, who is living,<br>
The glory of Jesus’ resurrection;<br>
Bright angels attesting,<br>
The shroud and napkin resting.<br>
Yes, Christ my hope is arisen;<br>
To Galilee he will go before you.”<br>
<br>
Christ indeed from death is risen, our new life obtaining;<br>
Have mercy, victor King, ever reigning!<br>
Amen. Alleluia.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse (cf. 1 Cor 5:7b-82)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Alleluia. Christ, our paschal lamb, has been sacrificed;<br>
<b>Together:</b> let us then feast with joy in the Lord. Alleluia.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 20:1-9)</h3>
<p>On the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark, and saw the stone removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know where they put him.” So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb. They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first; he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in. When Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, and the cloth that had covered his head, not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place. Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed. For they did not yet understand the Scripture that he had to rise from the dead.<br>
<br>
<b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>As we begin this Easter season, how can we better live, each and every day, in practical ways, our belief in the Resurrection of our blessed Lord?</li>
<li>Who might we send greetings to on this festive day?</li>
<li>Why do you think that Jesus did not appear to his enemies—those who had him put to death—in order to prove to them that he was truly the Son of God?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>
