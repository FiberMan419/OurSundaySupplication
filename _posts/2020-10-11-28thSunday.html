<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, October 11, 2020</h2>
<h3>Twenty-Eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p>All who hunger, gather gladly;<br>
Holy manna is our bread.<br>
Come from wilderness and wand’ring.<br>
Here, in truth, we will be fed.<br>
You that yearn for days of fullness,<br>
All around us is our food. <br>
Taste and see the grace eternal.<br>
Taste and see that God is good.</p>

<p>All who hunger, never strangers,<br>
Seeker, be a welcome guest.<br>
Come from restlessness and roaming.<br>
Here, in joy, we keep the feast.<br>
We that once were lost and scattered<br>
In communion’s love have stood.<br>
Taste and see the grace eternal.<br>
Taste and see that God is good.</p>

<p>All who hunger, sing together;<br>
Jesus Christ is living bread.<br>
Come from loneliness and longing.<br>
Here, in peace, we have been led.<br>
Blest are those who from this table<br>
Live their days in gratitude.<br>
Taste and see the grace eternal.<br>
Taste and see that God is good.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> May your grace, O Lord, we pray, <br>
at all times go before us and follow after <br>
and make us always determined <br>
to carry out good works. <br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 25:6–10a)</h3>
<p>On this mountain the LORD of hosts will provide for all peoples a feast of rich food and choice wines, juicy, rich food and pure, choice wines.  On this mountain he will destroy the veil that veils all peoples, the web that is woven over all nations; he will destroy death forever.  The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face; the reproach of his people he will remove from the whole earth; for the LORD has spoken.  On that day it will be said: "Behold our God, to whom we looked to save us!  This is the LORD for whom we looked; let us rejoice and be glad that he has saved us!"  For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain.</p>
<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 23:1–3a, 3b–4, 5, 6)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br>
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;<br>
beside restful waters he leads me;<br>
he refreshes my soul.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> He guides me in right paths<br>
for his name's sake.<br>
Even though I walk in the dark valley<br>
I fear no evil; for you are at my side<br>
with your rod and your staff<br>
that give me courage.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> You spread the table before me<br>
in the sight of my foes;<br>
you anoint my head with oil;<br>
my cup overflows.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Only goodness and kindness follow me<br>
all the days of my life;<br>
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD<br>
for years to come.<br>
<b>Together:</b> I shall live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians  (Philippians 4:12–14, 19–20)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: I know how to live in humble circumstances; I know also how to live with abundance.  In every circumstance and in all things I have learned the secret of being well fed and of going hungry, of living in abundance and of being in need.  I can do all things in him who strengthens me.  Still, it was kind of you to share in my distress.</p>

<p>My God will fully supply whatever you need, in accord with his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.  To our God and Father, glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse  (Ephesians 1:17-18)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> May the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ<br>
	enlighten the eyes of our hearts,<br>
<b>Together:</b> so that we may know what is the hope<br>
that belongs to our call.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 22:1–14)</h3>
<p>Jesus again in reply spoke to the chief priests and elders of the people in parables, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.  He dispatched his servants to summon the invited guests to the feast, but they refused to come.  A second time he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those invited: “Behold, I have prepared my banquet, my calves and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready; come to the feast.”’  Some ignored the invitation and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.  The rest laid hold of his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.  The king was enraged and sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.  Then he said to his servants, 'The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come.  Go out, therefore, into the main roads and invite to the feast whomever you find.’  The servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found, bad and good alike, and the hall was filled with guests.  But when the king came in to meet the guests, he saw a man there not dressed in a wedding garment.  The king said to him, 'My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding garment?'  But he was reduced to silence.  Then the king said to his attendants, 'Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the darkness outside, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.’  Many are invited, but few are chosen."</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Readings, Responsorial Psalm and Gospel all speak of the lavish generosity of God.  How have you experienced God’s generosity in your own life?</li>
<li>In the parable in the Gospel, the people invited to the feast refused to attend even though they were offered a sumptuous meal.  There are moments in our lives when we respond similarly to the invitation of the Lord.  What excuses or attachments keep you from responding fully to the invitation of the Lord?</li>
<li>One guest came to the feast without a wedding garment.  When asked why, he remained silent.  Why do you think we are not given an answer?  What does this garment signify to us?  How might we also be like this guest who comes to the feast unprepared?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Response to the Word</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> We give thanks to you, O God, as we call upon your name.<br>

<b>Leader:</b>	Glory to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.<br>

<h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>

<b>Response:</b> Containing in itself all delight, alleluia, alleluia.<br>

<b>Together:</b> My Jesus,<br>
I believe that you are present<br>
in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.<br>
I love you above all things,<br>
and I desire to receive you into my soul.<br>
Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally,<br>
come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
