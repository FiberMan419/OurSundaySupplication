<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, June 7, 2020</h2>
<h3>Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and even the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.<br>
<br>
During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion, since we are presently unable to receive Holy Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church. For, despite not being able to celebrate Mass together, this is certainly not a time to abandon the praise and supplication of almighty God, for he never abandons us! Now is the time to love and serve the Lord as best we can in our limited capacities.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p>Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!<br>
Early in the morning <br>
  our song shall rise to thee.<br>
Holy, Holy, Holy, merciful and mighty!<br>
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.<br>
<br>
Holy, Holy, Holy! All the saints adore thee.<br>
Casting down their golden crowns<br>
  around the glassy sea;<br>
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,<br>
God everlasting through eternity.<br>
<br>
Holy, Holy, Holy! Though the darkness hide thee,<br>
Though the eye made blind by sin<br>
  thy glory may not see,<br>
Only thou art holy; there is none beside thee,<br>
Perfect in pow’r, in love, and purity.<br>
<br>
Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!<br>
All thy works shall praise thy Name<br>
  in earth and sky and sea.<br>
Holy, Holy, Holy, merciful and mighty!<br>
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> God of mercy, you wash away our sins in water, you give us new birth in the Spirit, and redeem us in the blood of Christ. As we celebrate Christ’s resurrection, increase our awareness of these blessings, and renew your gift of life within us. We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the book of Exodus (Exodus 34:4B-6, 8-9)</h3>
<p>Early in the morning Moses went up Mount Sinai as the LORD had commanded him,
taking along the two stone tablets.  Having come down in a cloud, the LORD stood with Moses there and proclaimed his name, "LORD." Thus the LORD passed before him and cried out, "The LORD, the LORD, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity."  Moses at once bowed down to the ground in worship.  Then he said, "If I find favor with you, O Lord, do come along in our company.  This is indeed a stiff-necked people; yet pardon our wickedness and sins, and receive us as your own."<br>
<br>
<b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Daniel 3:52, 53, 54, 55, 56)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Glory and praise for ever!<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Glory and praise for ever!<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b> Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers,<br>
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever;<br>
And blessed is your holy and glorious name,<br>
praiseworthy and exalted above all for all ages.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Glory and praise for ever!<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b>	Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory,<br>
praiseworthy and glorious above all forever.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Glory and praise for ever!<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b>	Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom,<br>
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Glory and praise for ever!<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b>	Blessed are you who look into the depths<br>
from your throne upon the cherubim,<br>
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Glory and praise for ever!</p>

<h3>A Reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians  (2 Corinthians 13:11-13)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters, rejoice. Mend your ways, encourage one another, agree with one another, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.  All the holy ones greet you.<br>
<br>
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.<br>
<br>
<b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse (Cf. Revelation 1:8)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit;<br>
<b>Together:</b> to God who is, who was, and who is to come.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 3:16-18)</h3>
<p>God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life.  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.  Whoever believes in him will not be condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.<br>
<br>
<b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the first reading from the book of Exodus, God reveals himself to Moses as a "merciful and gracious God" and in the Gospel we hear that "God did not send his Son... to condemn the world."  What does it mean that God is a merciful God?</li>
<li>Today we contemplate the mystery of the Most Holy Trinity.  Where do you find the Three Persons in our readings today (especially the Second Reading)?  Why might Paul greet the Corinthians in the name of the Trinity?</li>
<li>Jesus prayed to his Father that his disciples may be one as he and the Father are one.  How can we reflect the unity of the Holy Trinity in our families, in our workplaces, our Church, and our communities?</li>
</ol>

Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>
