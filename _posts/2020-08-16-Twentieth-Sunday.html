<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, August 16, 2020</h2>
<h3>Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.
</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p>All people that on earth do dwell<br>
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;<br>
Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell;<br>
Come we before him and rejoice.</p>

<p>Know that the Lord is God indeed;<br>
Without our aid he did us make.<br>
We are his folk, he does us feed,<br>
And for his sheep he does us take.</p>

<p>O enter then his gates with praise;<br>
Approach with joy his courts unto;<br>
Praise, laud, and bless his Name always,<br>
For it is seemly so to do.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> O God, who have prepared for those who love you<br>
good things which no eye can see,<br>
fill our hearts, we pray, with the warmth of your love,<br>
so that, loving you in all things and above all things,<br>
we may attain your promises,<br>
which surpass every human desire.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 56:1, 6-7)</h3>
<p>Thus says the LORD: Observe what is right, do what is just; for my salvation is about to come, my justice, about to be revealed.</p>

<p>The foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, ministering to him, loving the name of the LORD, and becoming his servants—all who keep the sabbath free from profanation and hold to my covenant, them I will bring to my holy mountain and make joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on my altar, for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.</p>
<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 67:2-3, 5, 6, 8)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> O God, let all the nations praise you!<br>
<b>Together:</b>	O God, let all the nations praise you!</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> May God have pity on us and bless us;<br>
may he let his face shine upon us.<br>
So may your way be known upon earth;<br>
among all nations, your salvation.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	O God, let all the nations praise you!</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> May the nations be glad and exult<br>
because you rule the peoples in equity;<br>
the nations on the earth you guide.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	O God, let all the nations praise you!</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> May the peoples praise you, O God;<br>
may all the peoples praise you!<br>
May God bless us,<br>
and may all the ends of the earth fear him!<br>
<b>Together:</b>	O God, let all the nations praise you!</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans  (Romans 11:13-15, 29-32)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: I am speaking to you Gentiles.  Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I glory in my ministry in order to make my race jealous and thus save some of them.  For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</p>

<p>For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.  Just as you once disobeyed God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience, so they have now disobeyed in order that, by virtue of the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.  For God delivered all to disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse (cf. Matthew 4:23)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Jesus proclaimed the Gospel of the kingdom<br>
<b>Together:</b> and cured every disease among the people.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 15:21-28)</h3>
<p>At that time, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.  And behold, a Canaanite woman of that district came and called out, “Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented by a demon.”  But Jesus did not say a word in answer to her. Jesus’ disciples came and asked him, “Send her away, for she keeps calling out after us.” He said in reply, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”  But the  woman came and did Jesus homage, saying, “Lord, help me.”  He said in reply, “It is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs.”  She said, “Please, Lord, for even the dogs eat the scraps that fall from the table of their masters.” Then Jesus said to her in reply, “O woman, great is your faith!  Let it be done for you as you wish.”  And the woman’s daughter was healed from that hour.</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the First Reading, Isaiah announces that God’s house “will be a house of prayer for all people” – Jews and Gentiles alike – for those who “observe what is right” and “do what is just.” What is the relationship between our worship and our daily living? How can keeping God’s commands and pursuing justice add joy to our worship? How can you share Christ’s joy with others this week, especially with “foreigners” – those outside the communion of the Church?</li>
<li>In the Gospel, the Canaanite woman shows great faith and persistence in seeking healing for her daughter. What does it mean to be persistent in prayer? What role do trust and surrender play in our prayer and petition to God?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Response to the Word</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> We give thanks to you, O God, as we call upon your name.<br>
<b>Response:</b> We give thanks to you, O God, as we call upon your name.<br>

<b>Leader:</b>	We cry aloud how marvelous you are,<br>
<b>Response:</b> as we call upon your name.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b>	Glory to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.<br>
<b>Response:</b>	We give thanks to you, O God, as we call upon your name.</p>

<h2>Prayer of the Faithful</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Open your hearts to praise the God of power and goodness,
for he loves us and knows our needs.<br>
<b>Response:</b> We praise you, Lord, and trust in you.</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> We bless you, almighty God, King of the universe, because you called us while we were yet sinners to acknowledge your truth and to serve your majesty.<br>
<b>Response:</b> We praise you, Lord, and trust in you.</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> O God, you opened the gates of mercy for us, let us never turn aside from
the path of life.<br>
<b>Response:</b> We praise you, Lord, and trust in you.</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> As we celebrate the resurrection of your beloved Son, help us to spend this
day in the spirit of joy.<br>
<b>Response:</b> We praise you, Lord, and trust in you.</p>

<p><b>Leader:</b> Give to your faithful, O Lord, a prayerful spirit of gratitude, that we may

<h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us pray together as Jesus taught us:<br>
<b>Together:</b> Our Father, who art in heaven …</p>

<h2>Spiritual Communion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> You have given us bread from heaven, alleluia, alleluia.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Containing in itself all delight, alleluia, alleluia.<br>

<b>Together:</b> My Jesus,<br>
I believe that you are present<br>
in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.<br>
I love you above all things,<br>
and I desire to receive you into my soul.<br>
Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally,<br>
come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
