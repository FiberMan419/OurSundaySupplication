<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, September 27, 2020</h2>
<h3>Solemnity of Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, Archangels</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p>Holy God, we praise thy name;<br>
Lord of all, we bow before thee!<br>
All on earth thy scepter claim,<br>
All in heav’n above adore thee;<br>
Infinite thy vast domain, <br>
everlasting is thy reign.<br>
Infinite thy vast domain, <br>
everlasting is thy reign.</p>

<p>Hark! the loud celestial hymn<br>
Angel choirs above are raising;<br>
Cherubim and Seraphim,<br>
In unceasing chorus praising,<br>
Fill the heav’ns with sweet accord:<br>
“Holy, holy, holy Lord!”<br>
Fill the heav’ns with sweet accord: <br>
“Holy, holy, holy Lord!”</p>

<p>Holy Father, Holy Son,<br>
Holy Spirit, Three we name thee;<br>
While in essence only One,<br>
Undivided God we claim thee;<br>
And adoring bend the knee,<br>
While we own the mystery.<br>
And adoring bend the knee,<br>
While we own the mystery.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> O God, who dispose in marvelous order <br>
ministries both angelic and human, <br>
graciously grant <br>
that our life on earth may be defended <br>
by those who watch over us <br>
as they minister perpetually to you in heaven. <br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Daniel (Daniel 7:9-10, 13-14)</h3>
<p>As I watched: Thrones were set up and the Ancient One took his throne. His clothing was bright as snow, and the hair on his head as white as wool; His throne was flames of fire, with wheels of burning fire. A surging stream of fire flowed out from where he sat; Thousands upon thousands were ministering to him, and myriads upon myriads attended him.</p>

<p>The court was convened, and the books were opened. As the visions during the night continued, I saw: One like a son of man coming, on the clouds of heaven; When he reached the Ancient One and was presented before him, He received dominion, glory, and kingship; nations and peoples of every language serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away, his kingship shall not be destroyed.</p>
<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 138:1-2ab, 2cde-3, 4-5)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart, <br>
for you have heard the words of my mouth; <br>
in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise; <br>
I will worship at your holy temple and give thanks to your name.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Because of your kindness and your truth; <br>
for you have made great above all things <br>
your name and your promise. <br>
When I called, you answered me; <br>
you built up strength within me.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> All the kings of the earth shall give thanks to you, O LORD <br>
when they hear the words of your mouth; <br>
And they shall sing of the ways of the LORD <br>
“Great is the glory of the LORD.”<br>
<b>Together:</b>	In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Book of Revelation  (Revelation 12:7-12ab)</h3>
<p>War broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels battled against the dragon. The dragon and its angels fought back, but they did not prevail and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The huge dragon, the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, who deceived the whole world, was thrown down to earth, and its angels were thrown down with it.</p>

<p>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have salvation and power come, and the Kingdom of our God and the authority of his Anointed. For the accuser of our brothers is cast out, who accuses them before our God day and night. They conquered him by the Blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; love for life did not deter them from death. Therefore, rejoice, you heavens, and you who dwell in them.”</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Bless the Lord, all you angels,<br>
<b>Together:</b> his ministers, who do his will.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 1:47-51)</h3>
<p>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Here is a true child of Israel. There is no duplicity in him.” Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.” Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.” Jesus answered and said to him, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this.” And he said to him, “Amen, amen, I say to you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<p>God’s marvelous order of creation includes angels, beings of pure spirit. The word “angel” comes from the Greek work angelos which means messenger. God’s angels speak on his behalf, delivering divine messages for the good of humanity.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>
