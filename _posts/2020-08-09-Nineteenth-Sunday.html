<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, August 9, 2020</h2>
<h3>Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.
</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><b>V</b>	You shall cross the barren dessert,<br>
but you shall not die of thirst. <br>
You shall wander far in safety<br>
though you do not know the way.<br>
You shall speak your words in foreign lands<br>
and all will understand.<br>
You shall see the face of God and live. <b>R</b></p>

<p><b>R</b>	Be not afraid. <br>
	I go before you always.<br>
	Come, follow me, and I will give you rest.</p>

<p><b>V</b>	If you pass through raging waters in the sea<br>
you shall not drown. <br>
If you walk amid the burning flames,<br>
you shall not be harmed.<br>
If you stand before the pow’r of hell<br>
and death is at your side,<br>
know that I am with you through it all. <b>R</b></p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Draw near to your servants, O Lord,<br>
and answer their prayers with unceasing kindness,<br>
that, for those who glory in you as their Creator and guide,<br>
you may restore what you have created<br>
and keep safe what you have restored.<br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity<br>
of the Holy Spirit,<br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the first book of Kings (1 Kings 19:9A, 11-13A)</h3>
<p>At the mountain of God, Horeb, Elijah came to a cave where he took shelter.  Then the LORD said to him, “Go outside and stand on the mountain before the LORD; the LORD will be passing by.”  A strong and heavy wind was rending the mountains and crushing rocks before the LORD—but the LORD was not in the wind.  After the wind there was an earthquake—but the LORD was not in the earthquake.  After the earthquake there was fire—but the LORD was not in the fire.  After the fire there was a tiny whispering sound.  When he heard this, Elijah hid his face in his cloak and went and stood at the entrance of the cave.</p>
<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 85:9, 10, 11-12, 13-14)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> I will hear what God proclaims;<br>
the LORD — for he proclaims peace.<br>
Near indeed is his salvation to those who fear him,<br>
glory dwelling in our land.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Kindness and truth shall meet;<br>
justice and peace shall kiss.<br>
Truth shall spring out of the earth,<br>
and justice shall look down from heaven.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> The LORD himself will give his benefits;<br>
our land shall yield its increase.<br>
Justice shall walk before him,<br>
and prepare the way of his steps.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, let us see your kindness, and grant us your salvation.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans  (Romans 9:1-5)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie; my conscience joins with the Holy Spirit in bearing me witness that I have great sorrow and constant anguish in my heart.  For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my own people, my kindred according to the flesh.  They are Israelites; theirs the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises;
theirs the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse (cf. Psalms 130:5)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> I wait for the Lord;<br>
<b>Together:</b> my soul waits for his word.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 14:22-33)</h3>
<p>After he had fed the people, Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and precede him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.  After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray.  When it was evening he was there alone.  Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore, was being tossed about by the waves, for the wind was against it.</p>

<p>During the fourth watch of the night, he came toward them walking on the sea.  When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified.  “It is a ghost,” they said, and they cried out in fear.  At once Jesus spoke to them, “Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.”  Peter said to him in reply, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”  He said, “Come.”  Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus.  But when he saw how strong the wind was he became frightened; and, beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”  Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught Peter, and said to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?” After they got into the boat, the wind died down.  Those who were in the boat did him homage, saying, “Truly, you are the Son of God.”</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the First Reading, Elijah follows the Lord’s command and stands on the mountain to await His passing. Instead of being attended by mighty forces of nature, God passes by in “a tiny whispering sound.” When have you experienced God’s nearness in your life?  How was your experience similar or different to Elijah’s?</li>
<li>In the Gospel, Peter responds to Christ’s divine power by walking on the water at the Lord’s command. As he drew near to Jesus, Peter became afraid and began to sink.  What areas of your life have you had to entrust to Jesus in drawing near to him?  What areas of your life are you afraid to surrender to him?  What past experience of God’s power and care can you look to for encouragement to entrust yourself more fully to him?</li>
</ol>

in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.<br>
I love you above all things,<br>
and I desire to receive you into my soul.<br>
Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally,<br>
come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
