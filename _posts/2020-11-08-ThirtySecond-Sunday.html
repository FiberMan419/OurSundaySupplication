<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, November 8, 2020</h2>
<h3>Thirty-Second Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><b>V.</b>	I want to walk as a child of the light.<br>
I want to follow Jesus.<br>
God set the stars to give light to the world.<br>
The star of my life is Jesus. <b>R.</b></p>

<p><b>R.</b> 	In him there is no darkness at all.<br>
	The night and the day are both alike.<br>
	The Lamb is the light of the city of God.<br>
	Shine in my heart, Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> 	I want to see the brightness of God.<br>
	I want to look at Jesus.<br>
	Clear sun of righteousness shine on my path<br>
	And show me the way to the Father. <b>R.</b> </p>

<p><b>V.</b> 	I’m looking for the coming of Christ.<br>
	I want to be with Jesus.<br>
	When we have run with patience the race,<br>
	We shall know the joy of Jesus. <b>R.</b>
</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Almighty ever-living God,<br>
graciously keep from us all adversity, <br>
so that, unhindered in mind and body alike, <br>
we may pursue in freedom of heart the things that are yours. <br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of Wisdom (Wisdom 6:12–16)</h3>
<p>Resplendent and unfading is wisdom, and she is readily perceived by those who love her, and found by those who seek her.  She hastens to make herself known in anticipation of their desire; whoever watches for her at dawn shall not be disappointed, for he shall find her sitting by his gate.  For taking thought of wisdom is the perfection of prudence, and whoever for her sake keeps vigil shall quickly be free from care; because she makes her own rounds, seeking those worthy of her, and graciously appears to them in the ways, and meets them with all solicitude.</p>
<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 63:2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> O God, you are my God whom I seek;<br>
for you my flesh pines and my soul thirsts<br>
like the earth, parched, lifeless and without water.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Thus have I gazed toward you in the sanctuary<br>
to see your power and your glory,<br>
For your kindness is a greater good than life;<br>
my lips shall glorify you.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Thus will I bless you while I live;<br>
lifting up my hands, I will call upon your name.<br>
As with the riches of a banquet shall my soul be satisfied,<br>
and with exultant lips my mouth shall praise you.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> I will remember you upon my couch,<br>
and through the night-watches I will meditate on you:<br>
You are my help,<br>
and in the shadow of your wings I shout for joy.<br>
<b>Together:</b> My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians        (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18)</h3>
<p>We do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, about those who have fallen asleep, so that you may not grieve like the rest, who have no hope.   For if we believe that Jesus died and rose, so too will God, through Jesus, bring with him those who have fallen asleep.  Indeed, we tell you this, on the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will surely not precede those who have fallen asleep.  For the Lord himself, with a word of command, with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God, will come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.  Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.  Thus we shall always be with the Lord.  Therefore, console one another with these words.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse  (Matthew 24:42A, 44)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Stay awake and be ready!<br>
<b>Together:</b> For you do not know on what day your Lord will come.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 25:1–13)</h3>
<p>Jesus told his disciples this parable: "The kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins
who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.  Five of them were foolish and five were wise.  The foolish ones, when taking their lamps, brought no oil with them, but the wise brought flasks of oil with their lamps.  Since the bridegroom was long delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.  At midnight, there was a cry, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’ Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.  The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’  But the wise ones replied, 'No, for there may not be enough for us and you. Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.’  While they went off to buy it, the bridegroom came and those who were ready went into the wedding feast with him.  Then the door was locked.  Afterwards the other virgins came and said, ‘Lord, Lord, open the door for us!’ But he said in reply, ‘Amen, I say to you, I do not know you.’  Therefore, stay awake, for you know neither the day nor the hour."</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>What means do we have to grow in wisdom?  How do you seek wisdom in your own life?</li>
<li>How does keeping our ultimate end in mind lead to wisdom?</li>
<li>What does oil symbolize in the Gospel?  Were the wise virgins selfish because they refused to share with the foolish virgins?  How might we understand their action to be wise and not uncharitable?  Why would the bridegroom say that he does not know the foolish virgins when they arrive after going to buy oil?  What does this parable teach us about being prepared for the coming of the Lord?</li>
</ol>

and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
