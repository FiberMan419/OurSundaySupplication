#Our Sunday Supplication

##Sunday, March 22, 2020
##The Fourth Sunday of Lent

Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be
substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our
communities, our nation, and even the whole world, precautions have been made to limit the exponential
growth of COVID-19, including the suspension of public Masses in the Archdiocese.
So, if we cannot attend Mass on Sundays, how then are we, as a Church, to pray? This resource,
Our Sunday Supplication, is a recommended prayer of the Archdiocese. Unlike Mass, this order of prayer
can be offered by individuals and families, without the presence of a priest, and engages us in our Sunday
celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help
build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.
During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion, since we
are presently unable to receive Holy Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice,
recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his
Church. For, despite not being able to celebrate Mass together, this is certainly not a time to abandon the
praise and supplication of almighty God, for he never abandons us! Now is the time to love and serve the
Lord as best we can in our limited capacities
