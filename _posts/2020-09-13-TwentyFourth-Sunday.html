<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, September 13, 2020</h2>
<h3>Twenty-Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p>As we gather at your Table,<br>
As we listen to your word,<br>
Help us know, O God, your presence;<br>
Let our hearts and minds be stirred.<br>
Nourish us with sacred story<br>
Till we claim it as our own;<br>
Teach us through this holy banquet<br>
How to make Love’s vict’ry known.</p>

<p>Turn our worship into witness<br>
In the sacrament of life;<br>
Send us forth to love and serve you<br>
Bringing peace where there is strife.<br>
Give us, Christ, your great compassion<br>
To forgive as you forgave;<br>
May we still behold your image<br>
In the world you died to save.</p>

<p>Gracious Spirit, help us summon<br>
Other guests to share that feast<br>
Where triumphant Love will welcome<br>
Those who had been last and least.<br>
There no more will envy blind us<br>
Nor will pride our peace destroy,<br>
As we join with saints and angels<br>
To repeat the sounding joy.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Look upon us, O God, <br>
Creator and ruler of all things, <br>
and, that we may feel the working of your mercy, <br>
grant that we may serve you with all our heart. <br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of Sirach (Sirach 27:30—28:7)</h3>
<p>Wrath and anger are hateful things, yet the sinner hugs them tight. The vengeful will suffer the LORD’s vengeance, for he remembers their sins in detail.  Forgive your neighbor’s injustice; then when you pray, your own sins will be forgiven.  Could anyone nourish anger against another and expect healing from the LORD?  Could anyone refuse mercy to another like himself, can he seek pardon for his own sins?  If one who is but flesh cherishes wrath, who will forgive his sins?  Remember your last days, set enmity aside; remember death and decay, and cease from sin!  Think of the commandments, hate not your neighbor; remember the Most High’s covenant, and overlook faults.</p>
<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 103:1–2, 3–4, 9–10, 11–12)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, and rich in compassion.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, and rich in compassion.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Bless the LORD, O my soul;<br>
and all my being, bless his holy name.<br>
Bless the LORD, O my soul,<br>
and forget not all his benefits.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, and rich in compassion.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> He pardons all your iniquities,<br>
heals all your ills.<br>
He redeems your life from destruction,<br>
crowns you with kindness and compassion.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, and rich in compassion.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> He will not always chide,<br>
nor does he keep his wrath forever.<br>
Not according to our sins does he deal with us,<br>
nor does he requite us according to our crimes.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, and rich in compassion.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> For as the heavens are high above the earth,<br>
so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.<br>
As far as the east is from the west,<br>
so far has he put our transgressions from us.<br>
<b>Together:</b> The Lord is kind and merciful, slow to anger, and rich in compassion.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans  (Romans 14:7–9)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: None of us lives for oneself, and no one dies for oneself.  For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord; so then, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.  For this is why Christ died and came to life, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse (John 13:34)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> I give you a new commandment, says the Lord:<br>
<b>Together:</b> love one another as I have loved you.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 18:21–35)</h3>
<p>Peter approached Jesus and asked him, “Lord, if my brother sins against me, how often must I forgive?  As many as seven times?”</p>

<p>Jesus answered, “I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.  That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.   When he began the accounting, a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.  Since he had no way of paying it back, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, his children, and all his property, in payment of the debt.  At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.’  Moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan.  When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount.  He seized him and started to choke him, demanding, ‘Pay back what you owe.’  Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.’ But he refused.  Instead, he had the fellow servant put in prison until he paid back the debt.  Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master and reported the whole affair.  His master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant!  I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.  Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant, as I had pity on you?’ Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt.  So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives your brother from your heart.”</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<p>“As far as the east is from the west, so far has he put our transgressions from us.” This beautiful image from today’s Responsorial Psalm helps us to visualize God’s infinite love and mercy for us. As Christians, we are called to share that love and mercy with others.</p>
<ul>
<li>How are today’s readings about receiving and sharing divine mercy resonating in your heart? What is God saying to you through his Word today? Is God asking you to respond in prayer, in action, or in some other way?</li>
</ul>

<b>Together:</b> My Jesus,<br>

in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.<br>
I love you above all things,<br>
and I desire to receive you into my soul.<br>
Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally,<br>
come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
