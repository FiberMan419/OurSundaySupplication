<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, May 31, 2020</h2>
<h3>Feast of Pentecost</h3>

<p>As our churches begin to open up at least on a limited basis, and as we look forward in the coming weeks to even fewer restrictions placed on the public celebration of Masses, this will be the last installment of Our Sunday Supplication from the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas. We pray that this resource has been helpful to those who have made its use. Let us each, and all, continue to pray for an end to the present pandemic, for the health and safety of all, and for a renewed unity within the Church and our nation. That God may be glorified!</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p>Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,<br>
  And in our hearts take up thy rest;<br>
  Come with thy grace and heav’nly aid<br>
  To fill the hearts which thou hast made,<br>
  To fill the hearts which thou hast made.<br>
  <br>
  O Comforter, to the we cry,<br>
  Thou heav’nly gift of God most high;<br>
  Thou font of life and fire of love,<br>
  And sweet anointing from above,<br>
  And sweet anointing from above.<br>
  <br>
  To every sense thy light impart<br>
  And shed thy love in every heart.<br>
  To our weak flesh, thy strength supply;<br>
  Unfailing courage from on high,<br>
  Unfailing courage from on high.<br>
  <br>
  Praise be to thee, Father and Son<br>
  And Holy Spirit, with them one;<br>
  And may the Son on us bestow<br>
  The gifts that from the Spirit flow,<br>
  The gifts that from the Spirit flow.</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> God our Father, let the Spirit you sent on your Church to begin the teaching of the gospel continue to work in the world through the hearts of all who believe. We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:1-11)</h3>
<p>When the time for Pentecost was fulfilled, they were all in one place together. And suddenly there came from the sky a noise like a strong driving wind, and it filled the entire house in which they were. Then there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which parted and came to rest on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, as the Spirit enabled them to proclaim.<br>
<br>
Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven staying in Jerusalem. At this sound, they gathered in a large crowd, but they were confused because each one heard them speaking in his own language. They were astounded, and in amazement they asked, “Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans? Then how does each of us hear them in his own native language? We are Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya near Cyrene, as well as travelers from Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs, yet we hear them speaking in our own tongues of the mighty acts of God.”<br>
<br>
<b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 47:2-3, 6-7, 8-9)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Lord, send out your Spirit, and renew the face of the earth.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, send out your Spirit, and renew the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b> Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD, my God, you are great indeed!
How manifold are your works, O LORD! the earth is filled with your creatures.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, send out your Spirit, and renew the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b>	May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD be glad in all his works! Pleasing to him be my theme; I will be glad in the LORD.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, send out your Spirit, and renew the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
<b>Reader:</b>	If you take away their breath, they perish and return to their dust.
When you send forth your spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	Lord, send out your Spirit, and renew the face of the earth.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans (Romans 12:3b-7, 12-13)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the holy Spirit. There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit; there are different forms of service but the same Lord; there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit.<br>
<br>
As a body is one though it has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body, so also Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free persons, and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.<br>
<br>
<b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful<br>
<b>Together:</b> and kindle in them the fire of your love.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 20:19-23)</h3>
<p>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the doors were locked, where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace be with you.” When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained.”<br>
<br>
<b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Holy Spirit enabled the apostles to speak to everyone in the world. Even though we may not have been given this particular gift, how can we speak the Good News to those around us?</li>
<li>There are many gifts, but one same Holy Spirit. What is the advantage of each of us having received our own particular gifts? What particular gifts do you perceive as having received them from the Spirit?</li>
<li>Only an ordained priest has the particular gift to declare our sins absolved before God. But we, too, sometimes can “hold” a sin against another who wronged us. So, what can we, as laypersons, learn from Jesus’ words here, concerning our own role in bringing about reconciliation to and with others?</li>
</ol>

and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>Leader:</b> ✠ May the Lord bless us, protect us from all evil,
and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
