<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Sunday, October 4, 2020</h2>
<h3>Twenty-Seventh Sunday in Ordinary Time</h3>

<p>Holy Mass is at the very core of our worship as a Catholic community. Nothing can ever be substituted for the celebration of the Eucharist. But in this exceptional time of difficulty for our communities, our nation, and the whole world, this order of prayer can be offered by individuals and families and engages us in our Sunday celebration of the Word of God. We can pray this prayer in our homes—the “domestic churches” which help build up the Body of Christ on earth—and thus be connected to the entire Church at prayer.</p>

<p>During this time of prayer, we include the opportunity to make a Spiritual Communion. Making a Spiritual Communion is a worthy practice, recommended by innumerable saints throughout the ages, which unites our whole selves to God and his Church.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours</i></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> God, ✠ come to my assistance.<br>
<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
<b>Response:</b> as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>
<p><b>R.</b>	O Lord, you are the center of my life:<br>
	I will always praise you,<br>
	I will always serve you,<br>
	I will always keep you in my sight.</p>

<p><b>V.</b> 	Keep me safe, O God, I take refuge in you.<br>
	I say to the Lord, “You are my God.<br>
	My happiness lies in you alone;<br>
	My happiness lies in you alone.” <b>R.</b></p>

<p><b>V.</b>	You will show me the path of life,<br>
	the fullness of joy in your presence,<br>
	at your right hand, at your right hand<br>
	happiness for ever. <b>R.</b>
</p>

<h3>Act of Contrition</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b> Let us acknowledge our sins, and seek the Lord’s pardon and peace.<br>
<br>
<b>Together:</b> I confess to almighty God<br>
and to you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
that I have greatly sinned,<br>
in my thoughts and in my words,<br>
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,<br>
through my fault, through my fault,<br>
through my most grievous fault;<br>
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,<br>
all the Angels and Saints,<br>
and you, my brothers and sisters,<br>
to pray for me to the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b> Almighty ever-living God, <br>
who in the abundance of your kindness <br>
surpass the merits and the desires of those who entreat you, <br>
pour out your mercy upon us <br>
to pardon what conscience dreads<br>
and to give what prayer does not dare to ask. <br>
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <br>
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, <br>
one God, for ever and ever.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>

<h2>The Sunday Readings</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 5:1–7)</h3>
<p>Let me now sing of my friend, my friend's song concerning his vineyard.  My friend had a vineyard on a fertile hillside; he spaded it, cleared it of stones, and planted the choicest vines; within it he built a watchtower, and hewed out a wine press.  Then he looked for the crop of grapes, but what it yielded was wild grapes.</p>

<p>Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard: What more was there to do for my vineyard that I had not done?  Why, when I looked for the crop of grapes, did it bring forth wild grapes?  Now, I will let you know what I mean to do with my vineyard: take away its hedge, give it to grazing, break through its wall, let it be trampled!  Yes, I will make it a ruin: it shall not be pruned or hoed, but overgrown with thorns and briers; I will command the clouds not to send rain upon it. The vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the people of Judah are his cherished plant; he looked for judgment, but see, bloodshed! for justice, but hark, the outcry!</p>
<p><b>The Word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsorial Psalm (Psalm 80:9, 12, 13–14, 15–16, 19–20)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> A vine from Egypt you transplanted;
you drove away the nations and planted it.
It put forth its foliage to the Sea,
its shoots as far as the River.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Why have you broken down its walls,
so that every passer-by plucks its fruit,
The boar from the forest lays it waste,
and the beasts of the field feed upon it?<br>
<b>Together:</b>	The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Once again, O LORD of hosts,
look down from heaven, and see;
take care of this vine,
and protect what your right hand has planted
the son of man whom you yourself made strong.<br>
<b>Together:</b>	The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Then we will no more withdraw from you;
give us new life, and we will call upon your name.
O LORD, God of hosts, restore us;
if your face shine upon us, then we shall be saved.
<b>Together:</b> The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians  (Philippians 4:6–9)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.  Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.  Keep on doing what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me.  Then the God of peace will be with you.
</p>

<p><b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Gospel Verse  (John 15:16)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b> I have chosen you from the world, says the Lord,<br>
<b>Together:</b> to go and bear fruit that will remain.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 21:33–43)</h3>
<p>Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: "Hear another parable.  There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a tower.  Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey.  When vintage time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his produce.  But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat, another they killed, and a third they stoned.  Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first ones, but they treated them in the same way.  Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, 'They will respect my son.' But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir.  Come, let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.’  They seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.  What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes?"  They answered him, "He will put those wretched men to a wretched death and lease his vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the proper times."
Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures: The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; by the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes?  Therefore, I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce its fruit."
</p>

<p><b>The Gospel of the Lord.</b><br>
―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We hear in the First Reading and the Gospel that God has planted a vineyard and cared for it so that it will produce good fruit. That vineyard is his people, the house of Israel. How did God care for his people throughout the Old Testament, providing for them, tending them, and leading them? How did they go astray?</li>
<li>We are tenants in the vineyard of the Lord, and he expects that we produce good fruit for him from our labor. What work are you doing in the vineyard of the Lord and how is it producing fruit?  </li>
<li>In the second reading, St. Paul exhorts the Philippians to fix their thoughts on “whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious...” This is difficult in a world where so many things vie for our attention, often bombarding us with false messages, shocking images, and brutality. What is your response to St. Paul’s exhortation?</li>
</ol>

in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.<br>
I love you above all things,<br>
and I desire to receive you into my soul.<br>
Since I cannot at this moment receive you sacramentally,<br>
come at least spiritually into my heart.<br>
I embrace you as if you were already there<br>
and unite myself wholly to you.<br>
Never permit me to be separated from you,<br>
my Lord and my God!<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2>Canticle of Praise</h2>
<p><b>Canticle of Zechariah (Luke 1:68-79)</b><br>

<b>Together:</b> ✠ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;<br>
he has come to his people and set them free.<br>
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,<br>
born of the house of his servant David.<br>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old<br>
that he would save us from our enemies,<br>
from the hands of all who hate us.<br>
He promised to show mercy to our fathers<br>
and to remember his holy covenant.<br>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br>
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,<br>
free to worship him without fear,<br>
holy and righteous in his sight<br>
all the days of our life.<br>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;<br>
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,<br>
to give his people knowledge of salvation<br>
by the forgiveness of their sins.<br>
In the tender compassion of our God<br>
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,<br>
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,<br>
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,<br>
and to the Holy Spirit:<br>
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
world without end. Amen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

and bring us to everlasting life.<br>
<b>Together:</b> Amen.</p>
