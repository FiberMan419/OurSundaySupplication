<h1>Our Sunday Supplication</h1>

<h2>Saturday, April 11, 2020</h2>
<h3>Easter Vigil</h3>

<p>The Paschal Triduum, the solemn observance of the Church from Holy Thursday evening through Easter Sunday, is to the liturgical year what Sunday is to the week. During these days, the Church commemorates the saving mysteries of our Lord’s final moments of suffering and his first moments of resurrected glory. It has been said that only one man could turn three days of intrigue, betrayal and murder into the holiest week of the year. That man is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, our Lord!<br>
<br>
During this time of unprecedented suffering throughout the world, we need, as individuals and families, to attach ourselves to the sacramental life of the Church. We are able to do this, virtually, through the many generous live-streamed Masses and services being broadcast on television and the internet. We are able to do this, devotionally, through such powerful prayers as the Most Holy Rosary and the Chaplet of Divine Mercy. But we can also, truly and really, by praying over the Holy Scriptures and sacred texts of the very liturgies we are unable to celebrate in church. This supplication series amins at providing the “domestic church” an opportunity to use some of the sacred words used in the Church’s rites.<br>
<br>
Now is not a time to abandon the praise and supplication of almighty God, for he never abandons us! Now is the time to love and serve the Lord as best we can in our limited capacities.</p>

<h2>Order of Prayer</h2>
<p><b><i>Taken from the Vigil of the Resurrection and Easter Sunday Morning Prayer</i></b></p>
<p><i>Before we pray together, it would be fitting to place a lighted candle before us.</i></p>

<b>Response:</b> Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
<br>

<h3>Easter Proclamation</h3>
<p><b>Leader:</b>	It is truly right and just, with ardent love of mind and heart and with devoted service of our voice, to acclaim our God invisible, the almighty Father, and Jesus Christ, our Lord, his Son, his Only Begotten.<br>
<br>
<b>Response:</b>	Who for our sake paid Adam’s debt to the eternal Father, and, pouring out his own dear Blood, wiped clean the record of our ancient sinfulness.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b>	These then are the feasts of Passover, in which is slain the Lamb, the one true Lamb, whose Blood anoints the doorposts of believers.<br>
<br>
<b>Response:</b>	This is the night, when once you led our forebears, Israel’s children, from slavery in Egypt and made them pass dry-shod through the Red Sea.<br><br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b>	This is the night that with a pillar of fire banished the darkness of sin.<br>
<br>
<b>Response:</b>	This is the night that which even now, throughout the world, sets Christian believers apart from worldly vices and from the gloom of sin, leading them to grace and joining them to his holy ones.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b>	This is the night, when Christ broke the prison-bars of death and rose victorious from the underworld.<br>
<br>
<b>Response:</b>	O wonder of your humble care for us! O love, O charity beyond all telling, to ransom a slave you gave away your Son!<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b>	O truly necessary sin of Adam, destroyed completely by the Death of Christ!<br>
<br>
<b>Response:</b>	O happy fault that earned so great, so glorious a Redeemer!<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b>	The sanctifying power of this night dispels wickedness, washes faults away, restores innocence to the fallen, and joy to mourners.<br>
<br>
<b>Response:</b>	O truly blessed night, when things of heaven are wed to those of earth and divine to the human.<br>
<br>
<b>Response:</b>	Therefore, O Lord, we pray you that this candle, hallowed to the honor of your name, may persevere undimmed, to overcome the darkness of this night. Receive it as a pleasing fragrance, and let it mingle with the lights of heaven.<br>
<br>
<b>Leader:</b>	May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from death’s domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
<b>Response:</b>	Amen.</p>

<h2>The Word of the Lord</h2>
<h3>A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 1:1—2:2)</h3>
<p>In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters.<br>
<br>
Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness. God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." Thus evening came, and morning followed—the first day.<br>
<br>
Then God said, "Let there be a dome in the middle of the waters, to separate one body of water from the other." And so it happened: God made the dome, and it separated the water above the dome from the water below it. God called the dome "the sky." Evening came, and morning followed—the second day.<br>
<br>
Then God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered into a single basin, so that the dry land may appear." And so it happened: the water under the sky was gathered into its basin, and the dry land appeared. God called the dry land "the earth, " and the basin of the water he called "the sea." God saw how good it was.<br>
<br>
Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth vegetation: every kind of plant that bears seed
and every kind of fruit tree on earth that bears fruit with its seed in it." And so it happened: the earth brought forth every kind of plant that bears seed and every kind of fruit tree on earth that bears fruit with its seed in it. God saw how good it was. Evening came, and morning followed—the third day.<br>
<br>
Then God said: "Let there be lights in the dome of the sky, to separate day from night. Let them mark the fixed times, the days and the years, and serve as luminaries in the dome of the sky, to shed light upon the earth." And so it happened: God made the two great lights, the greater one to govern the day, and the lesser one to govern the night; and he made the stars. God set them in the dome of the sky, to shed light upon the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw how good it was. Evening came, and morning followed—the fourth day.<br>
<br>
Then God said, "Let the water teem with an abundance of living creatures, and on the earth let birds fly beneath the dome of the sky." And so it happened: God created the great sea monsters and all kinds of swimming creatures with which the water teems, and all kinds of winged birds. God saw how good it was, and God blessed them, saying, "Be fertile, multiply, and fill the water of the seas; and let the birds multiply on the earth." Evening came, and morning followed—the fifth day.<br>
<br>
Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth all kinds of living creatures: cattle, creeping things, and wild animals of all kinds." And so it happened: God made all kinds of wild animals, all kinds of cattle, and all kinds of creeping things of the earth. God saw how good it was.<br>
<br>
Then God said: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and the cattle, and over all the wild animals and all the creatures that crawl on the ground." God created man in his image; in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. God blessed them, saying: "Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and all the living things that move on the earth." God also said: "See, I give you every seed-bearing plant all over the earth and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit on it to be your food; and to all the animals of the land, all the birds of the air, and all the living creatures that crawl on the ground, I give all the green plants for food." And so it happened. God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good. Evening came, and morning followed—the sixth day.<br>
<br>
Thus the heavens and the earth and all their array were completed. Since on the seventh day God was finished with the work he had been doing, he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had undertaken.<br>

<h3>Responsory (Psalm 104:1)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b>	Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, you are very great.<br>
<p>Response:</b>	Lord, send out your Spirit, and renew the face of the earth.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 14:15—15:1)</h3>
<p>The LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. And you, lift up your staff and, with hand outstretched over the sea, split the sea in two, that the Israelites may pass through it on dry land. But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate that they will go in after them. Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and charioteers. The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I receive glory through Pharaoh and his chariots and charioteers."<br>
<br>
The angel of God, who had been leading Israel's camp, now moved and went around behind them. The column of cloud also, leaving the front, took up its place behind them, so that it came between the camp of the Egyptians and that of Israel. But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed without the rival camps coming any closer together all night long. Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD swept the sea with a strong east wind throughout the night and so turned it into dry land. When the water was thus divided, the Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br>
<br>
The Egyptians followed in pursuit; all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and charioteers went after them right into the midst of the sea. In the night watch just before dawn the LORD cast through the column of the fiery cloud upon the Egyptian force a glance that threw it into a panic; and he so clogged their chariot wheels that they could hardly drive. With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel, because the LORD was fighting for them against the Egyptians.<br>
<br>
Then the LORD told Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and their charioteers." So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth. The Egyptians were fleeing head on toward the sea, when the LORD hurled them into its midst. As the water flowed back, it covered the chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army which had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them escaped. But the Israelites had marched on dry land through the midst of the sea, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left. Thus the LORD saved Israel on that day from the power of the Egyptians. When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore and beheld the great power that the LORD had shown against the Egyptians,
they feared the LORD and believed in him and in his servant Moses.<br>
<br>
Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant; horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.<br>
<br>
<b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsory (Exodus 15:1)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b>	I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously; horse and rider he
has thrown into the sea.<br>
<p>Response:</b>	Let us sing to the Lord in his glorious triumph.</p>

<h3>A Reading from the Book of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 36:16-17a, 18-28))</h3>
<p>The word of the LORD came to me, saying: Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their land, they defiled it by their conduct and deeds. Therefore I poured out my fury upon them because of the blood that they poured out on the ground, and because they defiled it with idols. I scattered them among the nations, dispersing them over foreign lands; according to their conduct and deeds I judged them. But when they came among the nations wherever they came, they served to profane my holy name, because it was said of them: "These are the people of the LORD, yet they had to leave their land." So I have relented because of my holy name which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they came. Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord GOD: Not for your sakes do I act, house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name, which you profaned among the nations to which you came. I will prove the holiness of my great name, profaned among the nations, in whose midst you have profaned it. Thus the nations shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD, when in their sight I prove my holiness through you. For I will take you away from among the nations, gather you from all the foreign lands, and bring you back to your own land. I will sprinkle clean water upon you to cleanse you from all your impurities, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. I will give you a new heart and place a new spirit within you, taking from your bodies your stony hearts and giving you natural hearts. I will put my spirit within you and make you live by my statutes, careful to observe my decrees. You shall live in the land I gave your fathers; you shall be my people, and I will be your God.<br>
<br>
<b>The word of the Lord.</b><br>
―Thanks be to God.</p>

<h3>Responsory (Psalm 51:10)</h3>
<p><b>Reader:</b>	Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.<br>
<p>Response:</b>	Create a clean heart in me, O God.</p>

<h3>Hymn of Praise</h3>
<p>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will.<br>
<br>
We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify<br> you, we give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, heavenly King, O God, almighty Father.<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us; you take away the sins of the world,<br>
receive our prayer; you are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.<br>
<br>
For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High,<br><br>
Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.</p>

<h3>A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Romans (Romans 6:3-11)</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters: Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.<br>
<br>
For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection. We know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin. For a dead person has been absolved from sin. If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has power over him. As to his death, he died to sin once and for all; as to his life, he lives for God. Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as being dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><b>Reader:</b> Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;<br>
<b>Together:</b> His steadfast love endures forever. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.</p>

<h3>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 28:1-10)</h3>
<p>After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, approached, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. His appearance was like lightning and his clothing was white as snow. The guards were shaken with fear of him and became like dead men. Then the angel said to the women in reply, “Do not be afraid! I know that you are seeking Jesus the crucified. He is not here, for he has been raised just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.” Then they went away quickly from the tomb, fearful yet overjoyed, and ran to announce this to his disciples. And behold, Jesus met them on their way and greeted them. They approached, embraced his feet, and did him homage. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”<br>

―Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ</p>

<h3>For Reflection:</h3>
<ol>
<li>An amazing history, presented here briefly, is the story of our salvation. Reminded of the amazing love God has for each one of us, how can we live this love throughout this whole week: God’s love for us, our love for God, our love for one another?</li>
<li>Eastertide has begun this evening, and lasts for fifty days. How might we keep the joy of Easter alive during this whole time?</li>
<li>To whom might we send Easter greetings tomorrow?</li>
</ol>
