**Our Sunday Supplication** is a resource of the Archdiocese of the Kansas City in Kansas intended to help the faithful to pray at home while public Masses have been suspended. [St. Michael the Archangel](https://stmichaelcp.org/our-sunday-supplication) in Leawood, KS has an extensive list of resources and video guides for Our Sunday Supplication.

This site is a supplement to those resources primarily designed for those who prefer to follow along on their mobile device.
